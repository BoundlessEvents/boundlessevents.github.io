This website is not affiliated with Boundless, it's staff or Wonderstruck Games</br></br>
I (Emareks) created this site for anyone to be able to find a list of events going on in the boundless community.</br>
I realize that not everyone uses discord or the forums so I started keeping track of events I could attend with my guild.</br>
</br>
I attempt to add events I see posted on the forums on a public calendar, but I realize some people might want to maintain their own.</br>
Simply create a new public calendar and create a new issue on github and provide the public url link.</br>
Click <a href="https://github.com/BoundlessEvents/boundlessevents.github.io/issues">here</a> to open a new Issue on github.
